    <h3>MONOLOGUE</h3>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">This website records the interests I pursue outside professional work. Like a p-n junction, this is where the opposite sides of my brain meets.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Growing up I have always been torn between logic reasoning and artistic creation. I simply don't understand why we are made to choose between science and art, ever. Why not find a balancing point where I could straddle both worlds? I think if I could, it will be a very powerful thing.  This is my never ending journey in finding out who I was, who I am and who I will be. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">I travel and draw - both have been integral to my life whilst other interests come and go. Occasionally, I write stuff or just talk or video. Life is unpredictable and finite. I don't know if anything I do has any meaning. They are the dots of my life I can only connect at the end. I document them to the best I could so that when I think about the future, I don't feel sad. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">My life to date is split between Beijing (the first half) and London (the latter) including 18-month in New York. In between, on the road.
